# Split File

Split multipage files into their component pages. For example, if you have an
item containing one ten-page file, you can use this module to split it into ten
one-page files (assigned to the same item).

This module is not optimized to split very large multipage files. It was tested
on and should be used for files under 90 MB. Larger files should be split using
other tools and added to Omeka separately.

Guest (module for Omeka S)
==========================

> __New versions of this module and support for Omeka S version 3.0 and above
> are available on [GitLab], which seems to respect users and privacy better
> than the previous repository.__

[Guest] is a module for [Omeka S] that creates a role called `guest`, and
provides configuration options for a login and registration screen. Guests
become registered users in Omeka S, but have no other privileges to the admin
side of your Omeka S installation. This module is thus intended to be a common
module that other modules needing a guest user use as a dependency.

All features are available from api, in particular to log in, to log out, to
register, to update the password, to update its own profile and settings, or to
ajax forms. It does not replace the standard api (/api/users/#id), but adds some
checks and features useful to build ajax dialogs.

If you need more similar roles, you may use the module [Guest Private], that
provides two more roles: `guest_private_site`, who can see all sites, that are
public or private, but not private pages or resources; `guest_private`, who can
see all sites, site pages and resources that are public or private. Like
`guest`, they don't have admin permission and cannot go to the admin board.

The module is compatible with module [User Names] and [Two Factor Authentication].

The module includes a way to request api without credentials but via session, so
it's easier to use ajax in public interface or web application (see [omeka/pull/1714]).
The feature is included in Omeka S version 4.1.


Installation
------------

### Installation

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].

The module [Common] must be installed first.

* From the zip

Download the last release [Guest.zip] from the list of releases, and uncompress
it in the `modules` directory.

* From the source and for development

If the module was installed from the source, rename the name of the folder of
the module to `Guest`.

Then install it like any other Omeka module and follow the config instructions.

### Issue on upgrade

If you have a guest link in the main menu of the main site and the option to
redirect the main login page is set, the site won't work and you won't be able
to login during an upgrade of the module, even with the default login page /login.
In that case, revert back to the current version of the module, login in the
web interface, then upgrade the module on the system.

### Upgrade from module Guest User

The automatic upgrade from module [GuestUser], for data, settings and theme
templates, was removed in version 3.4.21. To upgrade from it when it is
installed, it is recommended to upgrade it first to version 3.3.5.1 or higher,
or to disable it. See [more information to upgrade templates] and code in other
files of [version 3.4.20].


Usage
-----

### Guest login form

A guest login form is provided in `/s/my_site/guest/login`.

### Guest register form

A guest login form is provided in `/s/my_site/guest/register`.

### Guest blocks for login and register

Site page blocks "Login" and "Register" are available too and can be added on any page.

### Terms agreement

A check box allows to force guests to accept terms agreement.

A button in the config forms allows to set or unset all guests acceptation,
in order to allow update of terms.

### Option redirect after log in

When the module [Shibboleth] is used, this option is bypassed.

### Custom theme: Main login form

In some cases, you may want to use the same login form for all users, so you may
have to adapt it. You may use the navigation link too (in admin > sites > my-site > navigation).

```php
<?php
if ($this->identity()):
    echo $this->hyperlink($this->translate('Log out'), $this->url()->fromRoute('site/guest/guest', ['site-slug' => $site->slug(), 'action' => 'logout']), ['class' => 'logout']);
else:
    echo $this->hyperlink($this->translate('Log in'), $this->url()->fromRoute('site/guest/anonymous', ['site-slug' => $site->slug(), 'action' => 'login']), ['class' => 'login']);
endif;
```

Api endpoint
------------

First, specify the roles that can log in by api in the config form of the module.
Note that to allow any roles to log in, in particular global admins, increase the
access points to check for security.

The main path is `/api/guest[/:action]` with all following actions that output
data as [jSend]:

- me
  Get infos about me (similar to /api/users/#id).

- login
  The user can log in with a post to `/api/login` with data `{"email":"elisabeth.ii@example.com","password"=""***"}`.
  In return, a session token will be returned. All other actions can be done
  with them: `/api/users/me?key_identity=xxx&key_credential=yyy`.

  If the option to create a local session cookie is set, the user will be
  authenticated locally too, so it allows to log in from a third party webservice,
  for example if a user logs in inside a Drupal site, he can log in the Omeka
  site simultaneously. This third party login should be done via an ajax call
  because the session cookie should be set in the browser, not in the server, so
  you can’t simply call the endpoint from the third party server. In you third
  party ajax, the header `Origin` should be filled in the request; this is
  generally the case with common js libraries.

  When a local session cookie is wanted, it is recommended to add a list of
  sites that have the right to log in the config for security reasons.

- logout

- session-token
  A session token can be created for api access. It is reset each time the user
  logs in or logs out. The api keys have no limited life in Omeka.

- register
  A visitor can register too, if allowed in the config. Register requires an
  email. Other params are optional: `username`, `password`, and `site` (id or
  slug, that may be required via the config).

- forgot-password
  Requires the eamail as argument.

- dialog
  Get an html dialog for ajax interaction. The argument is "name" with values
  "login", "register", "forgot-password", or "2fa-token" (for module [Two Factor Authentication]).

Some specific paths are added. They works the same than /api/guest/:action, but
the output is slightly different. They are kept for compatibility with old
third-party tools. Furthermore, they use key_identity/key_credential to
authenticate.

- /api/login
- /api/logout
- /api/session-token
- /api/register
- /api/forgot-password
- /api/users/me

The path `/api/users/me` is used for the user that is currently authenticated
through the credentials arguments. This is a shortcut to `/api/users/{id}` for
common actions, in particular to get the current user own data without knowking
the id.

Other http methods are available to update the profile with the same path. For
example to update (http method `PATCH`/`POST`):
- email: /api/users/me?email=elisabeth.ii@example.com
- name: /api/users/me?name=elisabeth_ii
- password: /api/users/me?password=xxx&new_password=yyy

In all other cases, you should use the standard api (`/api/users/#id`).


TODO
----

- [x] Move pages to a standard page, in particular register page (see module [ContactUs]).
- [x] Normalize all api routes and json for rest api (register, login, logout, session-token, forgot-password, dialog).
- [ ] Add an option to use key_identity/key_credential with GuestApiController and deprecate ApiController?


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
